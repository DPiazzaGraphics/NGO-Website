# NGO Website
Hi everyone. Here I have designed and coded a Social Welfare multipage website. 
The main Objective behind developing this website is that to work for the social development of underprivileged individual, groups or communities. With the help of volunteers we can organise social 
events which will help us in raising funds, so that we can fulfill their basic necessities and can provide them
a better lifestyle.

I have designed this project in HTML/CSS using Adobe Dreamweaver CC.

#### Technologies

Technologies I have included :

- bootstrap-4.0.0-dist
- bootstrap.min.css
- bootstrap.bundle.min.js
- jquery-3.2.1.min.js
- jquery-3.2.1.min
- jquery-1.11.3.min
- font-awesome-4.7.0

Here I have implemented a responsive framework to handle the dynamic content of the website and 
created an animated walkthrough of the UI.
